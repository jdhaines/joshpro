	    	<h2>Problem</h2>  <!-- Don't focus on the website, focus on solving the problem. -->
	    	<p>Four self defense instructors came to me looking for a community hub.  They wanted to connect with students on a daily basis and network with them.
	    	They also wanted to be able to host artcicles and their classes in one place.  They wanted to book classes, receive payments, and in the future have the option to sell merchandise.
	    	They wanted to be seen as a cohesive group while maintaining their own brands and identity within the group.</p>
	    	<h2>Solution</h2>
	    	<p>I provided a web solution that included a <a href="http://www.ParagonPride.com/forum">forum</a> to connect with students.  We set up an <a href="http://paragonpride.com/wp/?page_id=217">ecommerce system</a> 
	    	to allow classes to be purchased and paid directly to each instructor.  Finally, we styled the site in such a way that content could be linked to a specific instructor 
	    	simply through colors while maintaining a single brand for the group.</p>

	    	<h2>Problem</h2>  <!-- Don't focus on the website, focus on solving the problem. -->
	    	<p>A good friend of mine came to be with two propositions.  The first was he wanted me to be part of a training company he was starting.  The second, 
	    	he wanted me to be the webmaster and all around techno geek.  I accepted on both counts.  We needed a simple website to market and sell our classes.  
	    	In addition to simply a shopping cart, we wanted to be able to host articles and link to other relavent content in the industry.</p>
	    	<h2>Solution</h2>
	    	<p>I set up a website that met all of our needs.  The styling is <a href="http://www.PaladinCombatives.com">bold and clean</a>.  The brand matches our business cards and company shirts.  
	    	The classes are described and able to be booked directly from the website.  Our students can now read more information about our company, instructors, and 
	    	classes prior to deciding if we are right for their training needs.  Our class sales have increased dramatically and we have a much higher conversion rate
	    	of students visiting the site.</p>

	    	<h2>Problem</h2>  <!-- Don't focus on the website, focus on solving the problem. -->
	    	<p>The executive director asked me about a new website to interact more effectively with community donors, reach out to volunteers, 
	    	and broadcast their message to a wider audience.  The design needed to be professional and mesh well with the message they wanted to 
	    	broadcast.  Finally, the site needed to allow logins for both faculty and volunteers, manage the board member files, and allow content 
	    	to be updated by the RMHC team rather than the web devlopment team.</p>
	    	<h2>Solution</h2>
	    	<p>We developed out a web portal that met all the needs of the organization.  The members can log in and see their documents in a secure 
	    	fileshare, board members can access their meeting minutes, and donors can donate directly.  Visitors to the site will be appraised of 
	    	<a href="http://rmhcmichiana.org/beta/">upcoming events</a> and staff can input their own updates.  Overall, I think this project was a win-win for everyone involved with this fantastic
	    	 charity.</p>

	    	<h2>Problem</h2>  <!-- Don't focus on the website, focus on solving the problem. -->
	    	<p>For this project, my beautiful wife needed a new website.  Her requirements consisted of a simple and elegant website which could be used to both showcase her photography and allow customers to proof and purchase prints right from the website.</p>
	    	<h2>Solution</h2>
	    	<p>By using a popular photography back-end (or database) and custom design elements on the front-end we were able to create a functional and elegant website.  With her creative background and my construction abilities, we were able to find a perfect balance of design and function.  Her customers have been very pleased with their experience.</p>

	    	<h2>Problem</h2>  <!-- Don't focus on the website, focus on solving the problem. -->
	    	<p>A group of friends wanted to get together and create a training group in South Bend, IN.  They wanted to have a community site which primarily displayed a calendar of their training dates as well as explained their mission statement.</p>
	    	<h2>Solution</h2>
	    	<p>I provided the group with an easy to update, easy to manage, stylish website which accomplished their goals.  The primary page was a large calendar where they could put event inforamtion.  It included both commenting and discussion capability to include a place to chat about their training dates.  The training group was able to grow their membership and manage attendance on a daily basis.</p>

	    	<p>Three girlfriends decided to go in together and start a blog on advice for guys.  They wanted something simple, stylish, and easy to maintain.  
	    	The price requirements were low because this was simply a hobby project.</p>
	    	<h2>Solution</h2>
	    	<p>The site launched and took off like gangbusters with all three participants contributing lots of useful information.  Slowly the project became 
	    	less important and their daily lives took over.  After a few years it was decided to close the project.  The website is now closed down, but was 
	    	a good learning experience for everyone involved.</p>

	    	<h2>Problem</h2>  <!-- Don't focus on the website, focus on solving the problem. -->
	    	<p>My brother came to me and told me he was starting a small family owned construction company.  A year or two later he said he needed a website.  He wanted something simple that didn't require much maintenance.  He wanted it to be styled in a bold way that matched the colors and tyling he had picked out for his business.  Primarily it needed a contact form for his customers to reach him.  As a secondary goal, moving his company up on google search results would be a big positive.</p>
	    	<h2>Solution</h2>
	    	<p>We were able to build him a static hand-coded site that was easy to manage.  The contact form is functional, and the styling matches his trucks and overall company brand.  His search position has increased dramatically over the years, and he still gets multiple customers a month contacting him through the website.</p>

	    	<h2>Problem</h2>  <!-- Don't focus on the website, focus on solving the problem. -->
	    	<p>Mike owns a small construction company and was looking to get a web presence.  His customer would ask for his email address, and he couldn't 
	    	give them one.  He wanted a simple static website that wasn't going to break the bank.  He wanted a matching email address and a way for 
	    	his business to show in Google search results for his area.</p>
	    	<h2>Solution</h2>
	    	<p>As my first business client, I proposed a simple hand-coded <a href="http://www.constructionunlimited.us">static site</a>.  This met all of his requirements while coming in under budget.
	    	He still gets emails from potential customers and his website is highly ranked now that it has been around for so long.  It is a little 
	    	known fact that search engine rankings are highly motivated by the amount of time a website has been active.</p>
