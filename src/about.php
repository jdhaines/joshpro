            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to personally welcome you to the website for JoshPro.  &nbsp;My name is Josh Haines and I am the owner.  &nbsp;I started this small business in October of 2009 as a way to turn my hobby of working with computers into something a little more legitimate.  <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have enjoyed working with computers for many years, beginning in college. From there, I learned how to build PCs from scratch in order to get exactly the components that I wanted.  &nbsp;Friends and family members began asking me to build them computers when they saw the benefits received and value gained from custom PCs.  <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards the end of my time in college I began teaching myself the code required to build websites.  &nbsp;It began with a couple of small hobby sites and turned into another outlet for my hobby.  &nbsp;I started on a few small sites for customers and have slowly progressed from there.  &nbsp;I'm still very much learning, and attempt to grow my abilities with each new project.  &nbsp;The rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br /><a href=" javascript:history.back()" class="leftlink" >Back</a></p>
