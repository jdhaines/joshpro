            <p id="whymetext"><h2>Inexpensive</h2>I know that in today's economy price matters.  When big box stores are charging hundreds of dollars for doing virtually no work, it makes sense to find the "local computer guy" if at all possible.  If you compare the cost of my services against places like Geek Squad you can be sure you are saving huge amounts of money.<br />
            <h2>Great Service</h2> This isn't my career.  I do this work on the side as a hobby because I enjoy it.  I take great pride in making sure people are happy with the service I've provided.  Since I don't rely on this income to pay the bills it's easy for me to get things done right rather than worry about trying to make a buck.<br />
            <h2>Small Jobs Are OK</h2> I'm not looking for jobs that would take me hundreds of hours to complete, but working evenings and some weekends makes that impossible.  I like working on small problems for real people.  It's my niche, and I take pride in my work.</p>

            <p id="whymetext"><br />I've taken dozens of computers and cleaned them out, sped them up, and got them working like new again.

            <p>If your computer won't boot into Windows or won't turn on at all, I'll perform rigorous diagnostics to try and determine what the problem is.
